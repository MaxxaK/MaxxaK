- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaxxaK
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music, and making connections through both.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ in school, using HTML, CSS, and JS to design portfolios for friends, as well as furthering my knowledge of Java and Python through LeetCode.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will extend my knowledge of the languages above or anything in the tech field.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here I suppose.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
